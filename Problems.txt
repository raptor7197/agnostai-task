The multibatch try when fails it falls back to single event processing without retrying it.
should prolly implement a retry logic for the multibatch try 

right now the consumer is draining at a very slow rate if i can increase the batch process size in the docker file or increase teh handling capabilities in it 

teh api requests are blocked until kafka sends and ack to acknowledge the right  with high req with low batch size and batch timeout so kafka will become a bottle neck 

clickhouse write speeds are slow and Kafka consumer not committing offsets fast enough
clickhouse merges can compete 

can implement dlq for failed messages 
pagination can be implemented 


consumer has 2 modes 
1- batch processing 
2- single message if batch fails 

error handling can be improved for multibatch failure no proper retry mech exists
